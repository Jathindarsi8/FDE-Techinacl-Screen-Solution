# FDE-Techinacl-Screen-Solution
The purpose of this project, as explained in our previous conversation, is to provide a Python function for a technical screen. The function, named sort(width, height, length, mass), will categorize packages into one of three stacks: "STANDARD," "SPECIAL," or "REJECTED," based on whether they are bulky, heavy, or both.
